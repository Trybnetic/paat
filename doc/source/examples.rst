To ease working with PAAT and to make you able to analyze your GT3X files as soon
as possible, we made a collection of code snippets and jupyter notebooks. Feel
free to copy paste the things you need and adapt them to your needs. If you have
an example usage you think others might benefit from, let us know or open a
`Pull Request <https://github.com/trybnetic/paat/pulls>`_.
