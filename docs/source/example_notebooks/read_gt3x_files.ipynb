    "## Load a single GT3X file\n",
    "\n",
    "To load a single GT3X file, PAAT has implemented the `read_gt3x()` function, which will give you a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame and an integer with the sampling frequency in which the data was recorded. The sampling frequency can be relevant for several methods, but depending on your usecase, you might also ignore it. It can be also later calculated from the DataFrame's index which are the timestamps of when the data was recorded. In the following, we see a GT3X file loaded which recorded 10min for testing purposes of the package. As you can see in the following cell, the data recoridng started on 03.01.2022 at 10:20 and stopped ten minutes later at 10:30 with the last data point recorded 10ms before (as this data was recorded at 100hz = one recording each 10ms)."
