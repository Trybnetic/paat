	Infer non-wear time from raw 100Hz triaxial data. Data at different sample frequencies will be resampled to 100hz.

	Paper:
	A novel algorithm to detect non-wear time from raw accelerometer data using convolutional neural networks

	The steps are described in the paper but are summarized here too:


	Detect candidate non-wear episodes:
		Perform a forward pass through the raw acceleration signal and calculate the SD for each 1-minute interval and for each individual axis. 
		If the standard deviation is <= 0.004 g for all axes, record this 1-minute interval as a candidate non-wear interval. After all 1-minute 
		intervals have been processed, merge consecutive 1-minute intervals into candidate non-wear episodes and record their start and stop timestamps. 

	Merge bordering candidate non-wear episodes:
		Merge candidate non-wear episodes that are no more than 5 minutes apart and record their new start and stop timestamps. This step is required 
		to capture artificial movement that would typically break up two or more candidate non-wear episodes in close proximity.

	Detect the edges of candidate non-wear episodes:
		Perform a backward pass with a 1-second step size through the acceleration data from the start timestamp of a candidate non-wear episode and 
		calculate the SD for each individual axis. The same is applied for the stop timestamps with a forward pass and a step size of 1 second. 
		If the standard deviation of all axes is  <= 0.004 g, include the 1-second interval into the candidate non-wear episode and record the new 
		start or stop timestamp. Repeat until the standard deviation of the 1-second interval does not satisfy <= 0.004 g. As a result, the resolution 
		of the edges is now recorded on a 1-second resolution.

	Classifying the start and stop windows: 
		For each candidate non-wear episode, extract the start and stop segment with a window length of 3 seconds to create input features 
		for the CNN classification model. For example, if a candidate non-wear episode has a start timestamp of tstart a feature matrix is 
		created as (tstart – w  , tstart) x 3 axes with w = 3 seconds, resulting in an input feature with dimensions (300 x 3) for 100Hz data. 
		If both (i.e., logical ‘AND’) start and stop features are classified (through the CNN model) as non-wear time, the candidate non-wear 
		episode can be considered true non-wear time. If tstart is at t = 0, or tend is at the end of the acceleration data—meaning that 
		those candidate non-wear episodes do not have a preceding or following window to extract features from—classify the start or stop 
		as non-wear time by default.


	Parameters
	--------------
	raw_acc : np.array(n_samples, 3 axes)
		numpy array that contains raw triaxial data at 100hz. Size of the array should be (n_samples, 3)
	hz : int
		sample frequency of the data. The CNN model was trained for 100Hz of data. If the data is at a different sampling frequency it will be resampled to 100Hz
	cnn_model_file : os.path
		file location of the trained CNN model
	std_threshold : float (optional)
		standard deviation threshold to find candidate non-wear episodes. Default 0.004 g  
	distance_in_min : int (optional)
		causes two nearby candidate non-wear episodes not more than 'distance_in_min' apart to be grouped/merged together. This results in capturing artificial movement
		that would otherwise break up a longer candidate non-wear time. Defaults to 5 minutes.
	episode_window_sec : int (optional)
		length of the window to extract features from the start or the end of a candidate non-wear episode. If a non-wear episodes starts at time t, then a feature
		will be extracted from the raw data t-'episode_window_sec' to t. The same happens at the end of a candidate non-wear episode. So t-end untill t-end + 'episode_window_sec'
		Default to 7 seconds. Also note that a different value will need a different trained CNN model. 
	edge_true_or_false : Bool (optional)
		default classification if a candidate non-wear episode starts at the start of the acceleration data, so at t=0, or ends at the end of the acceleration data.
		In such cases, we can't obtain the feature at t-'episode_window_sec' since there is no data before t=0. In these cases, the start or stop of the candidate non-wear
		episode will be defaulted to True (non-wear time) or False (wear-time). Default value is True
	start_stop_label_decision : string ('or','and') (optional)
		Logical operator OR or AND to determine if a candidate non-wear episode should be considered non-wear time if only one side, either the start or the stop parts, is 
		inferred as non-wear time, or if both sides need to be inferred as non-wear time for the candidate non-wear time to be considered true non-wear time. Default to AND, meaning
		that both the start and the stop parts of the candidate non-wear time need to be inferred as non-wear time to allow the candidate non-wear time to be true non-wear time.
		In all other cases, the candidate non-wear time is then wear-time. 
	nwt_encoding : int (optional)
		encoding of non-wear time for the returning vector. Defaults to 1 
	wt_encoding : int (optional)
		encoding of wear time for the returning vector. Defaults to 0
	min_segment_length : int (optional)
		minimum length of the segment to be candidate for non-wear time
	sliding_window : int (optional)
		sliding window in minutes that will go over the acceleration data to find candidate non-wear segments
	verbose : Bool (optional)
		set to True if debug messages should be printed to the console and log file. Default False.

	Returns
	---------
	nw_vector : np.array(n_samples, 1)
		non-wear vector which has the same number of samples as 'raw_acc'. Every element has either a non-wear-time encoding or a wear-time encoding.
	nw_start_stop_indexes : list
		list of start and stop indexes that are considered non-wear time.

	Important
	---------
	-	If the data is not 100hz, then it will be resampled to 100hz. However, how the inference of non-wear time is affected by this has not been investigated.
	-	CNN models were trained with a hip worn accelerometer.

	Published: July 29, 2011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022922

	Accelerometer non-wear time was estimated on the basis of the standard deviation and the value range of each accelerometer axis, calculated for consecutive blocks of 30 minutes. 
	A block was classified as non-wear time if the standard deviation was less than 3.0 mg (1 mg = 0.00981 m·s−2) for at least two out of the three axes or if the value range, for 
	at least two out of three axes, was less than 50 mg.

	Important to note that the default encoding for this function of non-wear time = 0, and that of wear time is 1.

	Parameters
	----------
	data: np.array(n_samples, axes)

	hz: int (optional)
		sample frequency in hertz. Indicates the number of samples per 1 second. Default to 100 for 100hz. The sample frequency is necessary to 
		know how many samples there are in a specific window. So let's say we have a window of 15 minutes, then there are hz * 60 * 15 samples
	min_non_wear_time_window : int (optional)
		minimum window length in minutes to be classified as non-wear time
	window_overlap : int (optional)
		basically the sliding window that progresses over the acceleration data. Defaults to 15 minutes.
	std_mg_threshold : float (optional)
		standard deviation threshold in mg. Acceleration axes values below or equal this threshold can be considered non-wear time. Defaults to 3.0g. 
		Note that within the code we convert mg to g.
	std_min_num_axes : int (optional) 
		minimum numer of axes used to check if acceleration values are below the std_mg_threshold value. Defaults to 2 axes; meaning that at least 2 
		axes need to have values below a threshold value to be considered non wear time
	value_range_mg_threshold : float (optional)
		value range threshold value in mg. If the range of values within a window is below this threshold (meaning that there is very little change 
		in acceleration over time) then this can be considered non wear time. Default to 50 mg. Note that within the code we convert mg to g
	value_range_min_num_axes : int (optional)
		minimum numer of axes used to check if acceleration values range are below the value_range_mg_threshold value. Defaults to 2 axes; meaning that at least 2 axes need to have a value range below a threshold value to be considered non wear time
	nwt_encoding : int
		non-wear time encoding. Defaults to 0
	wt_encoding : int
		wear time encoding. Defaults to 1
