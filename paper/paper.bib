	abstract = {Accurate detection of accelerometer non-wear time is crucial for calculating physical activity summary statistics. In this study, we evaluated three epoch-based non-wear algorithms (Hecht, Troiano, and Choi) and one raw-based algorithm (Hees). In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to provide insight into the relationship between the algorithms’ hyperparameters and classification performance, as well as to generate tuned hyperparameter values to better detect episodes of wear and non-wear time. We used machine learning to construct a gold-standard dataset by combining two accelerometers and electrocardiogram recordings. The Hecht and Troiano algorithms achieved poor classification performance, while Choi exhibited moderate performance. Meanwhile, Hees outperformed all epoch-based algorithms. The sensitivity analysis and hyperparameter tuning revealed that all algorithms were able to achieve increased classification performance by employing larger intervals and windows, while more stringently defining artificial movement. These classification gains were associated with the ability to lower the false positives (type I error) and do not necessarily indicate a more accurate detection of the total non-wear time. Moreover, our results indicate that with tuned hyperparameters, epoch-based non-wear algorithms are able to perform just as well as raw-based non-wear algorithms with respect to their ability to correctly detect true wear and non-wear episodes.},

	abstract = {Background Few studies have compared the validity of objective measures of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) in pregnant and non-pregnant women. PAEE is commonly estimated with accelerometers attached to the hip or waist, but little is known about the validity and participant acceptability of wrist attachment. The objectives of the current study were to assess the validity of a simple summary measure derived from a wrist-worn accelerometer (GENEA, Unilever Discover, UK) to estimate PAEE in pregnant and non-pregnant women, and to evaluate participant acceptability. Methods Non-pregnant (N = 73) and pregnant (N = 35) Swedish women (aged 20–35 yrs) wore the accelerometer on their wrist for 10 days during which total energy expenditure (TEE) was assessed using doubly-labelled water. PAEE was calculated as 0.9×TEE-REE. British participants (N = 99; aged 22–65 yrs) wore accelerometers on their non-dominant wrist and hip for seven days and were asked to score the acceptability of monitor placement (scored 1 [least] through 10 [most] acceptable). Results There was no significant correlation between body weight and PAEE. In non-pregnant women, acceleration explained 24\% of the variation in PAEE, which decreased to 19\% in leave-one-out cross-validation. In pregnant women, acceleration explained 11\% of the variation in PAEE, which was not significant in leave-one-out cross-validation. Median (IQR) acceptability of wrist and hip placement was 9(8–10) and 9(7–10), respectively; there was a within-individual difference of 0.47 (p{\textless}.001). Conclusions A simple summary measure derived from a wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer adds significantly to the prediction of energy expenditure in non-pregnant women and is scored acceptable by participants.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances have transformed the research on physical activity initially based on questionnaire data to the most recent objective data from accelerometers. The shift to availability of raw accelerations has increased measurement accuracy, transparency, and the potential for data harmonization. However, it has also shifted the need for considerable processing expertise to the researcher. Many users do not have this expertise. The R package GGIR has been made available to all as a tool to convermulti-day high resolution raw accelerometer data from wearable movement sensors into meaningful evidence-based outcomes and insightful reports for the study of human daily physical activity and sleep. This paper aims to provide a one-stop overview of GGIR package, the papers underpinning the theory of GGIR, and how research contributes to the continued growth of the GGIR package. The package includes a range of literature-supported methods to clean the data and provide day-by-day, as well as full recording, weekly, weekend, and weekday estimates of physical activity and sleep parameters. In addition, the package also comes with a shell function that enables the user to process a set of input files and produce csv summary reports with a single function call, ideal for users less proficient in R. GGIR has been used in over 90 peer-reviewed scientific publications to date. The evolution of GGIR over time and widespread use across a range of research areas highlights the importance of open source software development for the research community and advancing methods in physical behavior research.},

	abstract = {To date, non-wear detection algorithms commonly employ a 30, 60, or even 90 mins interval or window in which acceleration values need to be below a threshold value. A major drawback of such intervals is that they need to be long enough to prevent false positives (type I errors), while short enough to prevent false negatives (type II errors), which limits detecting both short and longer episodes of non-wear time. In this paper, we propose a novel non-wear detection algorithm that eliminates the need for an interval. Rather than inspecting acceleration within intervals, we explore acceleration right before and right after an episode of non-wear time. We trained a deep convolutional neural network that was able to infer non-wear time by detecting when the accelerometer was removed and when it was placed back on again. We evaluate our algorithm against several baseline and existing non-wear algorithms, and our algorithm achieves a perfect precision, a recall of 0.9962, and an F1 score of 0.9981, outperforming all evaluated algorithms. Although our algorithm was developed using patterns learned from a hip-worn accelerometer, we propose algorithmic steps that can easily be applied to a wrist-worn accelerometer and a retrained classification model.},

	abstract = {Accelerometers are increasingly used to observe human behavior such as physical activity under free-living conditions. An important prerequisite to obtain reliable results is the correct calibration of the sensors. However, accurate calibration is often neglected, leading to potentially biased results. Here, we demonstrate and quantify the effect of accelerometer miscalibration on the estimation of objectively measured physical activity under free-living conditions. The total volume of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was significantly reduced after post hoc auto-calibration for uniaxial and triaxial count data, as well as for Euclidean Norm Minus One and mean amplitude deviation raw data. Weekly estimates of MVPA were reduced on average by 5.5, 9.2, 45.8, and 4.8 min, respectively, when compared to the original uncalibrated estimates. Our results indicate a general trend of overestimating physical activity when using factory-calibrated sensors. In particular, the accuracy of estimates derived from the Euclidean Norm Minus One feature suffered from uncalibrated sensors. For all modalities, the more uncalibrated the sensor was, the more MVPA was overestimated. This might especially affect studies with lower sample sizes.},

	abstract = {Accelerometers are frequently used to assess physical activity in large epidemiological studies. They can monitor movement patterns and cycles over several days under free-living conditions and are usually either worn on the wrist or the hip. While wrist-worn accelerometers have been frequently used to additionally assess sleep and time in bed behavior, hip-worn accelerometers have been widely neglected for this task due to their primary focus on physical activity. Here, we present a new method with the objective to identify the time in bed to enable further analysis options for large-scale studies using hip-placement like time in bed or sedentary time analyses. We introduced new and accelerometer-specific data augmentation methods, such as mimicking a wrongly worn accelerometer, additional noise, and random croping, to improve training and generalization performance. Subsequently, we trained a neural network model on a sample from the population-based Tromsø Study and evaluated it on two additional datasets. Our algorithm achieved an accuracy of 94\% on the training data, 92\% on unseen data from the same population and comparable results to consumer-wearable data obtained from a demographically different population. Generalization performance was overall good, however, we found that on a few particular days or participants, the trained model fundamentally over- or underestimated time in bed (e.g., predicted all or nothing as time in bed). Despite these limitations, we anticipate our approach to be a starting point for more sophisticated methods to identify time in bed or at some point even sleep from hip-worn acceleration signals. This can enable the re-use of already collected data, for example, for longitudinal analyses where sleep-related research questions only recently got into focus or sedentary time needs to be estimated in 24 h wear protocols.},

Even though activity counts have been the backbone of thousands of clinical and epidemiological studies, there are large variations of the algorithms that compute counts and their associated parameters—many of which have often been kept proprietary by device providers. This lack of transparency has hindered comparability between studies using different devices and limited their broader clinical applicability. ActiGraph devices have been the most-used wearable accelerometer devices for over two decades. Recognizing the importance of data transparency, interpretability and interoperability to both research and clinical use, we here describe the detailed counts algorithms of five generations of ActiGraph devices going back to the first AM7164 model, and publish the current counts algorithm in ActiGraph’s ActiLife and CentrePoint software as a standalone Python package for research use.

Therefore, efforts are needed to harmonize the methodology. In this article we reflect on how increased methodological harmonization may be achieved.

  Methods: The authors of this work convened for a two-day workshop (March 2014) themed on methodological harmonization of raw accelerometry. The discussions at the workshop were used as a basis for this review.

  Results: Key stakeholders were identified as manufacturers, method developers, method users (application), publishers, and funders. To facilitate methodological harmonization in raw accelerometry the following action points were proposed: i) Manufacturers are encouraged to provide a detailed specification of their sensors, ii) Each fundamental step of algorithms for processing raw accelerometer data should be documented, and ideally also motivated, to facilitate interpretation and discussion, iii) Algorithm developers and method users should be open about uncertainties in the description of data and the uncertainty of the inference itself, iv) All new algorithms which are pitched as “ready for implementation” should be shared with the community to facilitate replication and ongoing evaluation by independent groups, and v) A dynamic interaction between method stakeholders should be encouraged to facilitate a well-informed harmonization process.

  Conclusions: The workshop led to the iden -tification of a number of opportunities for harmonizing methodological practice. The discussion as well as the practical checklists proposed in this review should provide guidance for stakeholders on how to contribute to increased harmonization.},

It is used for sleep assessment in clinical sleep research, and as a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine. This update indicates that according to most studies, actigraphy has reasonable validity and reliability in normal individuals with relatively good sleep patterns. The validity of actigraphy in special populations or with individuals with poor sleep or with other sleep-related disorders is more questionable. The most problematic validity issue is the low specificity of actigraphy in detecting wakefulness within sleep periods reported with certain devices or samples. Overall, the recent literature adds to previous reports in demonstrating that actigraphy is sensitive in detecting unique sleep patterns associated with specific sleep disorders as well as with other medical or neurobehavioral disorders. Furthermore, actigraphy is sensitive in detecting sleep changes associated with drug treatments and non-pharmacologic interventions. Recent developments include the development of devices specially tailored to detect periodic limb movement in sleep and the introduction of new devices and algorithms. Because of the limitations of actigraphy, it is recommended to use complementary assessment methods (objective and subjective) whenever possible.},

However, the largest experiments conducted to date, have had only hundreds of participants. In this work, we processed the data of the recently published Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to have both PSG and actigraphy data synchronized. We propose the adoption of this publicly available large dataset, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than any other dataset, to systematically compare existing methods for the detection of sleep-wake stages, thus fostering the creation of new algorithms. We also implemented and compared state-of-the-art methods to score sleep-wake stages, which range from the widely used traditional algorithms to recent machine learning approaches. We identified among the traditional algorithms, two approaches that perform better than the algorithm implemented by the actigraphy device used in the MESA Sleep experiments. The performance, in regards to accuracy and F1 score of the machine learning algorithms, was also superior to the device’s native algorithm and comparable to human annotation. Future research in developing new sleep-wake scoring algorithms, in particular, machine learning approaches, will be highly facilitated by the cohort used here. We exemplify this potential by showing that two particular deep-learning architectures, CNN and LSTM, among the many recently created, can achieve accuracy scores significantly higher than other methods for the same tasks.},

	abstract = {Aims:The Troms? Study is an ongoing population-based health study in Troms?, Norway, initiated in 1974. The purpose of the seventh survey (Troms?7) 2015?2016 was to advance the population risk factor surveillance and to collect new types of data. We present the study design, data collection, attendance, and prevalence of risk factors and disease.Methods:All inhabitants in Troms? municipality, Norway, aged 40 years and older (N=32,591) were invited to a health screening including extensive questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, biological sampling (blood, urine, saliva, nasal/throat swabs, faeces), measurements (anthropometry, blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry) and clinical examinations (pain sensitivity, echocardiography, cognitive, physical, and lung function, accelerometer measurements, eye examinations, carotid ultrasound, electrocardiography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and heart, lung and carotid auscultation). New research areas in this round were dental and oral health examinations, collection of faecal samples for studies of normal bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance, and 24-hour urine samples for examination of sodium and iodine intakes.Results:Attendance was 65\% (N=21,083), and was higher in women, age group 50?79 years, previous attenders, and Norwegian-born individuals. Cardiovascular risk factor levels and prevalence of chronic obstructive lung disease decreased since the last survey, while the prevalence of obesity and diabetes increased.Conclusions:Attendance was stable from the sixth survey. Interaction with participants might be key to maintain participation. Favourable trends in risk factors continue, except for a continued increase in obesity. Both new data collection technology and traditional physical examinations will be crucial for the impact of future population studies.},

The present study details the quality control processes and the derivation of physical activity metrics from 100 Hz accelerometer data collected in the German National Cohort (NAKO). During the 2014 to 2019 baseline assessment, a subsample of NAKO participants wore a triaxial ActiGraph accelerometer on their right hip for seven consecutive days. Auto-calibration, signal feature calculations including Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) and Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD), identification of non-wear time, and imputation, were conducted using the R package GGIR version 2.10-3. A total of 73,334 participants contributed data for accelerometry analysis, of whom 63,236 provided valid data. The average ENMO was 11.7 ± 3.7 mg (milli gravitational acceleration) and the average MAD was 19.9 ± 6.1 mg. Notably, acceleration summary metrics were higher in men than women and diminished with increasing age. Work generated in the present study will facilitate harmonized analysis, reproducibility, and utilization of NAKO accelerometry data. The NAKO accelerometry dataset represents a valuable asset for physical activity research and will be accessible through a specified application process.},

	abstract = {Wearable physical activity sensors are widely used in research and practice as they provide objective measures of human behavior at a low cost. An important challenge for accurate assessment of physical activity behavior in free-living is the detection non-wear. Traditionally, heuristic algorithms that rely on specific interval lengths have been employed to detect non-wear time; however, machine learned models are emerging. We explore the potential of detecting non-wear using decision trees that combine raw acceleration and skin temperature, and we investigate the generalizability of our models, traditional heuristic algorithms, and recently developed machine learned models by external validation. The Decision tree models were trained using one week of data from thigh- and hip-worn accelerometers from 64 children. External validation was performed using data from wrist-worn accelerometers of 42 adolescents. For non-wear episodes longer than 60 min, the heuristic algorithms performed the best with F1-scores above 0.96. However, regarding episodes shorter than 60 min, the best performing method was the decision tree model including the six most important predictors with F1 scores above 0.74 for all sensor locations. We conclude that for classifying non-wear time, researchers should carefully select an appropriate method and we encourage the use of external validation when reporting on machine learned non-wear models.},

These rich data not only provide opportunities to improve PA characterisation, but also bring logistical and analytic challenges. We discuss how researchers and developers from multiple disciplines are responding to the analytic challenges and how advances in data storage, transmission and big data computing will minimise logistical challenges. These new approaches also bring the need for several paradigm shifts for PA researchers, including a shift from count-based approaches and regression calibrations for PA energy expenditure (PAEE) estimation to activity characterisation and EE estimation based on features extracted from raw acceleration signals. Furthermore, a collaborative approach towards analytic methods is proposed to facilitate PA research, which requires a shift away from multiple independent calibration studies. Finally, we make the case for a distinction between PA represented by accelerometer-based devices and PA assessed by self-report.},

	abstract = {Background Physical activity has not been objectively measured in prospective cohorts with sufficiently large numbers to reliably detect associations with multiple health outcomes. Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the UK Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. Methods Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100Hz raw triaxial acceleration data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. Results 103,712 datasets were received (44.8\% response), with a median wear-time of 6.9 days (IQR:6.5–7.0). 96,600 participants (93.3\%) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7.5\% (2.35mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen’s d = 0.9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45-54yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0.66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0.12 for men, d = 0.09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0.27 for men, d = 0.15 for women) were small. Conclusions It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent in the afternoon and evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the UK Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses.},

Significant research efforts have focused on wearable algorithm design and deployment in both research and clinical settings; however, open-source, general-purpose software tools for processing various activities of daily living are relatively scarce. Furthermore, few studies include code for replication or off-the-shelf software packages. In this work, we introduce SciKit Digital Health (SKDH), a Python software package (Python Software Foundation) containing various algorithms for deriving clinical features of gait, sit to stand, physical activity, and sleep, wrapped in an easily extensible framework. SKDH combines data ingestion, preprocessing, and data analysis methods geared toward modern data science workflows and streamlines the generation of digital endpoints in “good practice” environments by combining all the necessary data processing steps in a single pipeline. Our package simplifies the construction of new data processing pipelines and promotes reproducibility by following a convention over configuration approach, standardizing most settings on physiologically reasonable defaults in healthy adult populations or those with mild impairment. SKDH is open source, as well as free to use and extend under a permissive Massachusetts Institute of Technology license, and is available from GitHub (PfizerRD/scikit-digital-health), the Python Package Index, and the conda-forge channel of Anaconda.},

          Purpose 
          This study was designed to establish prediction models that relate hip and wrist accelerometer data to energy expenditure (EE) in field and laboratory settings. We also sought to determine whether the addition of a wrist accelerometer would significantly improve the prediction of EE (METs), compared with a model that used a hip accelerometer alone.
          Methods 
          Seventy participants completed one to six activities within the categories of yardwork, housework, family care, occupation, recreation, and conditioning, for a total of 5 to12 participants tested per activity. EE was measured using the Cosmed K4b2 portable metabolic system. Simultaneously, two Computer Science and Applications, Inc. (CSA) accelerometers (model 7164), one worn on the wrist and one worn on the hip, recorded body movement. Correlations between EE measured by the Cosmed and the counts recorded by the CSA accelerometers were calculated, and regression equations were developed to predict EE from the CSA data.
          Results 
          The wrist, hip, and combined hip and wrist regression equations accounted for 3.3\%, 31.7\%, and 34.3\% of the variation in EE, respectively. The addition of the wrist accelerometer data to the hip accelerometer data to form a bivariate regression equation, although statistically significant (P = 0.002), resulted in only a minor improvement in prediction of EE. Cut points for 3 METs (574 hip counts), 6 METs (4945 hip counts), and 9 METs (9317 hip counts) were also established.
          Conclusion 
          The small amount of additional accuracy gained from the wrist accelerometer is offset by the extra time required to analyze the data and the cost of the accelerometer.},

	abstract = {Accelerometers have become a popular and indispensable tool to objectively measure various aspects of daily behavior. While physical activity can be estimated relatively easy, sedentary behavior requires reliable Time in Bed and non-wear time algorithms. Over the years, various algorithms have been proposed, but little is known about how these algorithms quantitatively influence the estimation of sedentary behavior. In this study, we systematically compared different data processing strategies and their effect on sedentary behavior in 6155 participants asked to wear an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. We found considerable variation in the estimates ranging from 183 min to 807 min per day, mainly due to considerable influence by time-in-bed algorithms and sedentary thresholds. Non-wear time algorithms, on the other hand, only had a minor influence on the estimation of sedentary time, despite substantial variation between the algorithms. Our results suggest that sedentary behavior estimates from accelerometers must be interpreted with respect to the methods used to obtain them. When results from different studies are compared, the data should be reprocessed in a harmonized way.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe author(s) received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data collection of the Troms{\o} Study has been approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (REC North ref. 2014/940) and the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, and all participants gave written informed consent.
