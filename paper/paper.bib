	abstract = {Accurate detection of accelerometer non-wear time is crucial for calculating physical activity summary statistics. In this study, we evaluated three epoch-based non-wear algorithms (Hecht, Troiano, and Choi) and one raw-based algorithm (Hees). In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to provide insight into the relationship between the algorithms’ hyperparameters and classification performance, as well as to generate tuned hyperparameter values to better detect episodes of wear and non-wear time. We used machine learning to construct a gold-standard dataset by combining two accelerometers and electrocardiogram recordings. The Hecht and Troiano algorithms achieved poor classification performance, while Choi exhibited moderate performance. Meanwhile, Hees outperformed all epoch-based algorithms. The sensitivity analysis and hyperparameter tuning revealed that all algorithms were able to achieve increased classification performance by employing larger intervals and windows, while more stringently defining artificial movement. These classification gains were associated with the ability to lower the false positives (type I error) and do not necessarily indicate a more accurate detection of the total non-wear time. Moreover, our results indicate that with tuned hyperparameters, epoch-based non-wear algorithms are able to perform just as well as raw-based non-wear algorithms with respect to their ability to correctly detect true wear and non-wear episodes.},

	abstract = {Background Few studies have compared the validity of objective measures of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) in pregnant and non-pregnant women. PAEE is commonly estimated with accelerometers attached to the hip or waist, but little is known about the validity and participant acceptability of wrist attachment. The objectives of the current study were to assess the validity of a simple summary measure derived from a wrist-worn accelerometer (GENEA, Unilever Discover, UK) to estimate PAEE in pregnant and non-pregnant women, and to evaluate participant acceptability. Methods Non-pregnant (N = 73) and pregnant (N = 35) Swedish women (aged 20–35 yrs) wore the accelerometer on their wrist for 10 days during which total energy expenditure (TEE) was assessed using doubly-labelled water. PAEE was calculated as 0.9×TEE-REE. British participants (N = 99; aged 22–65 yrs) wore accelerometers on their non-dominant wrist and hip for seven days and were asked to score the acceptability of monitor placement (scored 1 [least] through 10 [most] acceptable). Results There was no significant correlation between body weight and PAEE. In non-pregnant women, acceleration explained 24\% of the variation in PAEE, which decreased to 19\% in leave-one-out cross-validation. In pregnant women, acceleration explained 11\% of the variation in PAEE, which was not significant in leave-one-out cross-validation. Median (IQR) acceptability of wrist and hip placement was 9(8–10) and 9(7–10), respectively; there was a within-individual difference of 0.47 (p{\textless}.001). Conclusions A simple summary measure derived from a wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer adds significantly to the prediction of energy expenditure in non-pregnant women and is scored acceptable by participants.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances have transformed the research on physical activity initially based on questionnaire data to the most recent objective data from accelerometers. The shift to availability of raw accelerations has increased measurement accuracy, transparency, and the potential for data harmonization. However, it has also shifted the need for considerable processing expertise to the researcher. Many users do not have this expertise. The R package GGIR has been made available to all as a tool to convermulti-day high resolution raw accelerometer data from wearable movement sensors into meaningful evidence-based outcomes and insightful reports for the study of human daily physical activity and sleep. This paper aims to provide a one-stop overview of GGIR package, the papers underpinning the theory of GGIR, and how research contributes to the continued growth of the GGIR package. The package includes a range of literature-supported methods to clean the data and provide day-by-day, as well as full recording, weekly, weekend, and weekday estimates of physical activity and sleep parameters. In addition, the package also comes with a shell function that enables the user to process a set of input files and produce csv summary reports with a single function call, ideal for users less proficient in R. GGIR has been used in over 90 peer-reviewed scientific publications to date. The evolution of GGIR over time and widespread use across a range of research areas highlights the importance of open source software development for the research community and advancing methods in physical behavior research.},

	abstract = {To date, non-wear detection algorithms commonly employ a 30, 60, or even 90 mins interval or window in which acceleration values need to be below a threshold value. A major drawback of such intervals is that they need to be long enough to prevent false positives (type I errors), while short enough to prevent false negatives (type II errors), which limits detecting both short and longer episodes of non-wear time. In this paper, we propose a novel non-wear detection algorithm that eliminates the need for an interval. Rather than inspecting acceleration within intervals, we explore acceleration right before and right after an episode of non-wear time. We trained a deep convolutional neural network that was able to infer non-wear time by detecting when the accelerometer was removed and when it was placed back on again. We evaluate our algorithm against several baseline and existing non-wear algorithms, and our algorithm achieves a perfect precision, a recall of 0.9962, and an F1 score of 0.9981, outperforming all evaluated algorithms. Although our algorithm was developed using patterns learned from a hip-worn accelerometer, we propose algorithmic steps that can easily be applied to a wrist-worn accelerometer and a retrained classification model.},

	abstract = {Accelerometers are increasingly used to observe human behavior such as physical activity under free-living conditions. An important prerequisite to obtain reliable results is the correct calibration of the sensors. However, accurate calibration is often neglected, leading to potentially biased results. Here, we demonstrate and quantify the effect of accelerometer miscalibration on the estimation of objectively measured physical activity under free-living conditions. The total volume of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was significantly reduced after post hoc auto-calibration for uniaxial and triaxial count data, as well as for Euclidean Norm Minus One and mean amplitude deviation raw data. Weekly estimates of MVPA were reduced on average by 5.5, 9.2, 45.8, and 4.8 min, respectively, when compared to the original uncalibrated estimates. Our results indicate a general trend of overestimating physical activity when using factory-calibrated sensors. In particular, the accuracy of estimates derived from the Euclidean Norm Minus One feature suffered from uncalibrated sensors. For all modalities, the more uncalibrated the sensor was, the more MVPA was overestimated. This might especially affect studies with lower sample sizes.},

	abstract = {Introduction Human body acceleration is often used as an indicator of daily physical activity in epidemiological research. Raw acceleration signals contain three basic components: movement, gravity, and noise. Separation of these becomes increasingly difficult during rotational movements. We aimed to evaluate five different methods (metrics) of processing acceleration signals on their ability to remove the gravitational component of acceleration during standardised mechanical movements and the implications for human daily physical activity assessment. Methods An industrial robot rotated accelerometers in the vertical plane. Radius, frequency, and angular range of motion were systematically varied. Three metrics (Euclidian norm minus one [ENMO], Euclidian norm of the high-pass filtered signals [HFEN], and HFEN plus Euclidean norm of low-pass filtered signals minus 1 g [HFEN+]) were derived for each experimental condition and compared against the reference acceleration (forward kinematics) of the robot arm. We then compared metrics derived from human acceleration signals from the wrist and hip in 97 adults (22–65 yr), and wrist in 63 women (20–35 yr) in whom daily activity-related energy expenditure (PAEE) was available. Results In the robot experiment, HFEN+ had lowest error during (vertical plane) rotations at an oscillating frequency higher than the filter cut-off frequency while for lower frequencies ENMO performed better. In the human experiments, metrics HFEN and ENMO on hip were most discrepant (within- and between-individual explained variance of 0.90 and 0.46, respectively). ENMO, HFEN and HFEN+ explained 34\%, 30\% and 36\% of the variance in daily PAEE, respectively, compared to 26\% for a metric which did not attempt to remove the gravitational component (metric EN). Conclusion In conclusion, none of the metrics as evaluated systematically outperformed all other metrics across a wide range of standardised kinematic conditions. However, choice of metric explains different degrees of variance in daily human physical activity.},

Sixty children and adults wore an ActiGraph and GENEActiv on the hip and wrist while performing six structured activities, before wearing the monitors, in addition to an activPAL, for 24 h. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine sedentary thresholds based on activities in the laboratory. Agreement between developed sedentary thresholds during free-living and activPAL were assessed by Bland-Altman plots and by calculating sensitivity and specificity. Using laboratory data and ROC-curves showed similar classification accuracy for wrist and hip thresholds (Area under the curve = 0.84–0.92). Greatest sensitivity (97–98\%) and specificity (74–78\%) were observed for the wrist thresholds, with no large differences between brands. During free-living, Bland-Altman plots showed large mean individual biases and 95\% limits of agreement compared with activPAL, with smallest difference for the ActiGraph wrist threshold in children (+30 min, P = 0.3). Sensitivity and specificity for the developed thresholds during free-living were low for both age groups and for wrist (Sensitivity, 68–88\%, Specificity, 46–59\%) and hip placements (Sensitivity, 89–97\%, Specificity, 26–34\%). Laboratory derived sedentary thresholds generally overestimate free-living sedentary time compared with activPAL. Wrist thresholds appear to perform better than hip thresholds for estimating free-living sedentary time in children and adults relative to activPAL, however, specificity for all the developed thresholds are low.},

        The study aims were to compare raw triaxial accelerometer output from ActiGraph GT3X+ (AG) and GENEActiv (GA) placed on the hip and the wrist and to develop regression equations for estimating energy expenditure.
        Methods 
        Thirty children (7–11 yr) and 30 adults (18–65 yr) completed eight activities (ranging from lying to running) while wearing one AG and one GA on the hip and the wrist. Oxygen consumption (V˙O2) was measured with indirect calorimetry. Analysis involved the use of ANOVA to examine the effect of activity, brand, and placement on the acceleration values, intraclass correlation coefficient to evaluate the agreement between the two brands and placements, and linear regression to establish intensity thresholds.
        Results 
        A significant difference in acceleration values between the hip and the wrist placement was found (P {\textless} 0.001). The output from the wrist placement was, in general, higher compared with that from the hip. There was no main effect of monitor brand in adults (P {\textless} 0.12) and children (P {\textless} 0.73), and the intraclass correlation coefficient showed a strong agreement (0.96–0.99). However, a three-way interaction and systematic error between the brands was found in children. Acceleration from both brands and placements showed a strong correlation with V˙O2. The intensity classification accuracy of the developed thresholds for both brands and placements was, in general, higher for adults compared with that for children and was greater for sedentary/light (93\%–97\%), and vigorous activities (68\%–92\%) than that for moderate activities (33\%–59\%).
        Conclusions 
        Accelerometer outputs from AG and GA seem comparable when attached to the same body location in adults, whereas inconsistent differences are apparent between the two brands and placements in children, hence limiting the comparability between brands in this age group.},

	title = {{Automatic} time in bed detection from hip-worn accelerometers for large epidemiological studies: {The} {Tromsø} {Study}},
	abstract = {Accelerometers are frequently used to assess physical activity in large epidemiological studies. They can monitor movement patterns and cycles over several days under free-living conditions and are usually either worn on the wrist or the hip. While wrist-worn accelerometers have been frequently used to additionally assess sleep and time in bed behavior, hip-worn accelerometers have been widely neglected for this task due to their primary focus on physical activity. Here, we present a new method to identify the time in bed to enable further analysis options for large-scale studies using hip-placement. We introduced new and accelerometer specific data augmentation methods to improve training and generalization performance. Subsequently, we trained a neural network model on a sample from the population-based Tromsø Study and evaluated it on two additional data sets. Our algorithm achieved an accuracy of 95\% on the training data, 92% on unseen data from the same population and comparable results to consumer-wearable data obtained from a demographically different population. Generalization performance was overall good, however, we found that on some particular days or participants, the trained model significantly over- or underestimated time in bed. Despite these limitations, we anticipate our approach to be a starting point for more sophisticated methods to identify time in bed or at some point even sleep from hip-worn acceleration signals. This can enable the re-use of already collected data, for example, for longitudinal analyses where sleep-related research questions only recently got into focus or sedentary time needs to be estimated in 24h wear protocols. },

        This study aimed to implement an aggregation method in Matlab for generating ActiGraph counts from raw acceleration recorded with an alternative accelerometer device and to investigate the validity of the method.
        Methods 
        The aggregation method, including the frequency band-pass filter, was implemented and optimized based on standardized sinusoidal acceleration signals generated in Matlab and processed in the ActiLife software. Evaluating the validity of the aggregation method was approached using a mechanical setup and with a 24-h free-living recording using a convenient sample of nine subjects. Counts generated with the aggregation method applied to Axivity AX3 raw acceleration data were compared with counts generated with ActiLife from ActiGraph GT3X+ data.
        Results 
        An optimal band-pass filter was fitted resulting in a root-mean-square error of 25.7 counts per 10 s and mean absolute error of 15.0 counts per second across the full frequency range. The mechanical evaluation of the proposed aggregation method resulted in an absolute mean ± SD difference of −0.11 ± 0.97 counts per 10 s across all rotational frequencies compared with the original ActiGraph method. Applying the aggregation method to the 24-h free-living recordings resulted in an epoch level bias ranging from −16.2 to 0.9 counts per 10 s, a relative difference in the averaged physical activity (counts per minute) ranging from −0.5\% to 4.7\% with a group mean ± SD of 2.2\% ± 1.7\%, and a Cohen’s kappa of 0.945, indicating almost a perfect agreement in the intensity classification.

        The proposed band-pass filter and aggregation method is highly valid for generating ActiGraph counts from raw acceleration data recorded with alternative devices. It would facilitate comparability between studies using different devices collecting raw acceleration data.},

	abstract = {Digital clinical measures based on data collected by wearable devices have seen rapid growth in both clinical trials and healthcare. The widely-used measures based on wearables are epoch-based physical activity counts using accelerometer data. Even though activity counts have been the backbone of thousands of clinical and epidemiological studies, there are large variations of the algorithms that compute counts and their associated parameters—many of which have often been kept proprietary by device providers. This lack of transparency has hindered comparability between studies using different devices and limited their broader clinical applicability. ActiGraph devices have been the most-used wearable accelerometer devices for over two decades. Recognizing the importance of data transparency, interpretability and interoperability to both research and clinical use, we here describe the detailed counts algorithms of five generations of ActiGraph devices going back to the first AM7164 model, and publish the current counts algorithm in ActiGraph’s ActiLife and CentrePoint software as a standalone Python package for research use. We believe that this material will provide a useful resource for the research community, accelerate digital health science and facilitate clinical applications of wearable accelerometry.},

	abstract = {Objective Accelerometers are increasingly used for objective assessment of physical activity. However, because of lack of the proprietary analysis algorithms, direct comparisons between accelerometer brands are difficult. In this study, we propose and evaluate open source methods for commensurate assessment of raw accelerometer data irrespective of the brand. Design Twenty-one participants carried simultaneously three different tri-axial accelerometers on their waist during five different sedentary activities and five different intensity levels of bipedal movement from slow walking to running. Several time and frequency domain traits were calculated from the measured raw data, and their performance in classifying the activities was compared. Results Of the several traits, the mean amplitude deviation (MAD) provided consistently the best performance in separating the sedentary activities and different speeds of bipedal movement from each other. Most importantly, the universal cut-off limits based on MAD classified sedentary activities and different intensity levels of walking and running equally well for all three accelerometer brands and reached at least 97\% sensitivity and specificity in each case. Conclusion Irrespective of the accelerometer brand, a simply calculable MAD with universal cut-off limits provides a universal method to evaluate physical activity and sedentary behaviour using raw accelerometer data. A broader application of the present approach is expected to render different accelerometer studies directly comparable with each other.},
